# weather
my first project, a flask application which shows the weather in the wanted location.
with a full devops platform which include: 
- Kubernetes
- Buildah
- Jenkins
- Argo CD

- HashiCorp Vault

**All of the manifests for the tools mentioned above are in a different repository called 'weather-gitops**
